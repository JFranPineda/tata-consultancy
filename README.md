## Feedback
- We tried to work with https://randomuser.me/api API Random User Generator, but we encountered many problems when working with this API.
- For simple projects and for developers, it is easier to work with Mocks which gives you some of the data to work with.
- Another alternative is to work with the Mongo Db Atlas, I have used it in some projects in 2020 and it is really easy to create and implement your own database in the cloud.
- The last and most efficient alternative to get scalable software is to upload all the data to the AWS servers. It's not that easy, but it's the best way to store all your data and build really useful functions in Serverless Lambda AWS.
- One thing that is really important to build views is getting the expected animations of a button or component. At this point, we use our creativity to create three- or four-button animations and the same number of component animations.
- I found it very interesting to work with the BEM Methodology, it was really useful and new for me, but I understand it after 2 days of intense reading.
